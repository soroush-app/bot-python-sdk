## Installation ##
Use git (first make sure it's installed on your os) then run the below commands:
*if you'r not using 'git' just download zip file from above and extract it*
```bash
git clone https://github.com/soroush-app/bot-python-sdk
cd bot-python-sdk
```
then run below command (where you see 'requirements.txt' file):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
OR:

```

## Usage ##

```python
from client import Client

bot_token = 'your bot token'

bot = Client(bot_token)

try:
    to = 'user chat_id'

    [error, success] = bot.send_text(to, 'Your text')

    if success:
        print('Message sent successfully')
    else:
        print('Sending message failed: {}' .format(error))

except Exception as e:
    print(e.args[0])


```
"to" value in above example is chat_id of a bot user. You can find it in front of 'from' key in a message that user has sent to your bot.
